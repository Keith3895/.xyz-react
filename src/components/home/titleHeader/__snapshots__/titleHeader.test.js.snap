  <h1>Keith Franklin Jathanna</h1>
  <h2>Hi there! I am Keith Franklin. I am a full stack web-developer; basically a guy who makes websites. I live in the beautiful garden city - Bangalore, India. Most of my websites are developed with NodeJS on the back-end and with React or Angular as the front-end framework. I try to compose programs with the simple idea that \\"Writing code is also art\\". The notion of programs being art may come off as a stretch for someone who doesn't write programs but I believe there is a beauty, joy and wonder to it. I'm exploring the short but intersting history of computers and the different ideas that were incepted from them.</h2>
